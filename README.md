## What has been done
I have built a basic text-editing desktop app capable of performing CRUD operations on txt files. I have also implemented a few text formating features.

## Issues/challenges
1. After applying any text formating feature on a text file and opening it again results in the entire text of the file formated with the last applied text formating feature.
2. Text formating features are not toggle buttons. Sepeate menu options are created to achieve the reverse effect. 

## Features
1. Basic functionalities of text-editing apps like:
    1. New, Open, Save, Save As under File menu
    2. Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo under Edit menu

2. Text formating features are also implemented like:
    1. Bold
    2. Subscript
    3. Superscript.

3. An 'About Me' section which display my resume in a dialogue box.
